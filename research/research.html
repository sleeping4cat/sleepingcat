        <!-- Project: A New Type of AlexNet - WasteNet Recreation -->
        <div class="project active">
            <h3>A New Type of AlexNet - WasteNet Recreation</h3>
            <p>AlexNet is widely considered one of the best large Neural Network models, especially in Computer Vision. I've recreated WasteNet, a new Image Classification Model developed by UK Government researchers, in Tensorflow. This project leverages fine-tuning and Hybrid Tuning for faster and better image classification results, preventing destruction of information in the fine-tuning stage.</p>

        <div class="project active">
            <h3>GUI for Object Detection (YOLO v5) - WasteClassification</h3>
            <p>I've developed a personalized GUI for local Object Detection tasks. Using Flask as the backend, this project provides a light-weight inference interface with outstandingly simple and well-documented code.</p>

        <!-- Project: Competitive Programming - Wolfram Challenge -->
        <div class="project active">
            <h3>Competitive Programming - Wolfram Challenge</h3>
            <p>Fascinated by Competitive Programming, I perceive it as a cornerstone in understanding Computer Algorithms. I started practicing Competitive Programming Questions from Wolfram Mathematica and will begin LeetCode in 2024.</p>

        <!-- Project: Presence Monitor -->
        <div class="project active">
            <h3>Presence Monitor</h3>
            <p>I developed a project that allows anyone on the internet to see when I was last seen online. It cleverly tracks my online presence through a system that runs a script locally and fetches metadata from a GitHub repository to track the last commit done by me. Updated every hour, 24 times a day.</p>

        <!-- Project: GitHub Search Engine -->
        <div class="project active">
            <h3>GitHub Search Engine</h3>
            <p>Streamlined GitHub search with a new search engine. It searches for usernames and repositories based on the query terms provided by an individual and returns the results.</p>

        <div class="project active">
            <h3>One-step PDF Extractor - Nougat-OP</h3>
            <p>Created a Python wrapper around Meta AI (FAIR)'s state-of-art OCR model, Nougat, for one-step PDF and LaTeX extraction.</p>

        <!-- Project: Bash Blog -->
        <div class="project active">
            <h3>Bash Blog</h3>
            <p>Developed a personal blog template in Computer Science and AI, based on Chad Baldwinâ€™s template. Created as an alternative to mainstream platforms like Medium, providing a platform for quality content without unnecessary pressure to monetize.</p>
